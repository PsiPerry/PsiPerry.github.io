        As you may know, I attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering.

      As you may not know, I attended Creighton Prep in Omaha for my highschool. Yes, I know. Terrible, terrible. Get it all out now.

      I didn't specialize in anything particular as I went about my schooling, but I did learn towards the end that coding, and further on, Software Development is what I wanted to pursue as a career.
      Initially, I wanted to be able to create video games for people to enjoy just as I appreciated them when I was younger, but this grew to be far more challenging than orginally expected. Making a game in general let alone by yourself is a very time-consuming and arduous task.
      Every single thing you need to know how to fix or create with little outside help. It won't stop me from trying in the future when I have a bit more time on my hands though.

      In highschool, I prided myself on my competitive swimming achievements both with my team and individually. Before I had joined the swim team, Creighton Prep had secured 10 straight state championships, making them the prime contender to beat.
      The 4 long years of improving my stroke technique, meeting new friends, and defeating opponents changed me for the better to be the person I am today. It taught me discipline and the thrill of competition. The best part of all was I was able to share in that 
      competition as a victor, both with my team and in an individual event. A part of me does miss swimming and all of my friends I've met there, but that doesn't mean that we all can't meet up every once in a while to checkup on eachother.
